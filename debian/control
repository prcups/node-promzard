Description: Promzard provides a prompting json wizard
 A prompting wizard for building files from specialized PromZard modules.
 Used by npm init.
 .
 A reimplementation of SubStack's prompter, which does not use AST traversal.
 .
 From another point of view, it's a reimplementation of Marak's wizard
 which doesn't use schemas.
 .
 The goal is a nice drop-in enhancement for npm init.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
